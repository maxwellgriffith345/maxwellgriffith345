## [Formula 1 Project](https://github.com/maxwellgriffith345/Python_Projects)
   Skills & Technology: Python, SQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn <br/>
   A data mining project built to scrape all Formula 1 race results for years 1950 - 2020, exctracting over 20,000 lines of data. I leveraged Python libraries Beautfil Soup for HTML parcing and Pandas' data frame tools. I cleaned the data in excel, created a database, and used SQL to answer questions about drivers,treams and circuits. [F1 SQL](https://github.com/maxwellgriffith345/SQL_Projects/tree/main/F1DataBase)  Using Seaborn and Matplotlib I created [visualizations](https://github.com/maxwellgriffith345/Python_Projects/tree/main/F1_Vis) for the battle betweent the top two drivers during the 2020 season. <br/>
