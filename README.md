## [Formula 1 Project](https://github.com/maxwellgriffith345/Python_Projects)
   A data mining project to scrap the race results for every race from 1950 - 2020, exctracting over 20,000 lines of data. The data includes drivers name, finishg position, points earned, race location, race circuit, race date, and laps raced. I leveraged Beautfil Soups HTML parcing and Pandas data frame tools to find the infromatin I needed and load it to a matrix. <br/>
  I then cleaned the data and prerped it for analysis. Many of the tracks and drivers names are formated with excluded characters. I searched the data for invalid characters and replaced them with useable alternatives.  <br/>
  I loaded the data into a local database and used SQL to run quries with the motivation of answering basic facts about driver perofmrance. [F1 SQL](https://github.com/maxwellgriffith345/SQL_Projects/tree/main/F1DataBase)  <br/>
