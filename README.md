## [Formula 1 Project](https://github.com/maxwellgriffith345/Python_Projects)
   Skills Used: Python, SQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn <br/>
   A data mining project built to scrape the race results for 1950 - 2020, exctracting over 20,000 lines of data. I leveraged Python libraries Beautfil Soup for HTML parcing and Pandas' data frame tools. I cleaned the data in excel, created a database, and used SQL to answer questions about drivers,treams and circuits. [F1 SQL](https://github.com/maxwellgriffith345/SQL_Projects/tree/main/F1DataBase)  Diving into the ccontentious  2020 season I created visualizations for the battle betweent he top two drivers. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib I created different views to show the points battle.<br/>
